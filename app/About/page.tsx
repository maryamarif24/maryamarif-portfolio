                <p className="text-[24px] font-serif p-5 my-4">I m a frontend web developer passionate about transforming ideas into interactive digital 
                    experiences. With a keen eye for design and a focus on clean, efficient code, I create 
                    visually appealing and responsive websites that bring imaginations to life. My expertise 
                    in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React allows me to build user-friendly 
                    interfaces that enhance the way people connect with technology.

                    When I m not coding, I m constantly exploring new tools and techniques to stay ahead 
                    in the ever-evolving world of web development. I m excited to continue pushing the 
                    boundaries of what is possible online and turning creative visions into reality.</p>
