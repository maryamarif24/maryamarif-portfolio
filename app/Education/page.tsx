                    After high school, I enrolled in a private college, where I expanded my knowledge of programming 
                    languages and web frameworks. This period allowed me to deepen my skills in web development, focusing 
                    on building interactive, user-friendly designs. My college experience introduced me to hands-on projects 
                    that enhanced my ability to turn abstract concepts into fully functioning digital products.

                    Currently, I am pursuing <span className="text-[#970747]">A Levels</span> in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics, a curriculum that is 
                    further strengthening my analytical and problem-solving skills. This advanced academic grounding is 
                    helping me refine my understanding of complex algorithms, data structures, and logical approaches essential 
                    for efficient web development.
